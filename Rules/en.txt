Make lines with the same color or shape in a strategic way and score as many points as possible

At the start of the game, every player gets 6 tiles
Every tile has a color and a shape

You can take one of 2 actions on your turn
Adding tiles:
Add one or more tiles with the same color or shape to the game board
The added tiles all have to be in one line, but they don't have to touch
After adding tiles you get new tiles from the bag, until you have 6 tiles in your hand again
Trading tiles:
Trade tiles from your hand with tiles from the bag

Scoring points:
You gain points for every tile in the line you create (including the tiles that were already there)
If you complete a line of 6 tiles, you score a Qwirkle. This gets you 6 bonus points

The game ends when a player has used up all their tiles or when nobody can add or trade tiles anymore
If you're the first to use up all your tiles, you get 6 bonus points
The player with the highest score wins
